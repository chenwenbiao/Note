Maven vs Gradle Build Script Major Elements

If we observe both maven＊s pom.xml and gradle＊s build.gradle file, 
we can find the following things.

MAVEN ELEMENTS	GRADLE ELEMENTS

<groupId>	Gradle＊s ※group§ Element
<artifactId>	Gradle＊s ※baseName§ Element
<version>	Gradle＊s ※version§ Element

1. Like Maven, we can integrate existing ANT tasks in Gradle and use them in our projects.
2. Like Maven, we can create our own project specific Gradle tasks and use them in our projects.
3. We can even Integrate Maven tasks with Gradle build tool.

Maven vs Gradle commands

The following table lists all important maven and gradle commands.

MAVEN COMMAND	GRADLE COMMAND

mvn package	gradle assemble
mvn test	gradle test
mvn clean	gradle clean
mvn 每help	gradle 每help
mvn install	gradle install
mvn 每version	gradle 每version

It＊s a brief comparison between Maven vs Gradle build tools. 
It＊s not enough to include everything in one post to list all commands with suitable examples. 
I hope we have given enough basics to dig into these two tools further to become an expert.
