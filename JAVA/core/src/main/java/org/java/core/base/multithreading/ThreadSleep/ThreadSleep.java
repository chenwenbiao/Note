package org.java.core.base.multithreading.ThreadSleep;

/**
 * hread.sleep() method can be used to pause the 
 * execution of current thread for specified time in milliseconds.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Java Thread Sleep important points</strong>
 * 1. It always pause the current thread execution.
 * 2. The actual time thread sleeps before waking up and start 
 * execution depends on system timers and schedulers. For a quiet 
 * system, the actual time for sleep is near to the specified sleep 
 * time but for a busy system it will be little bit more.
 * 3. Thread sleep doesnâ€™t lose any monitors or locks current thread has acquired.
 * 4. Any other thread can interrupt the current thread in sleep, 
 * in that case InterruptedException is thrown.
 * 
 * <strong>How Thread Sleep Works</strong>
 * Thread.sleep() interacts with the thread scheduler to put the 
 * current thread in wait state for specified period of time. 
 * Once the wait time is over, thread state is changed to runnable state 
 * and wait for the CPU for further execution. So the actual time that current 
 * thread sleep depends on the thread scheduler that is part of operating system.
