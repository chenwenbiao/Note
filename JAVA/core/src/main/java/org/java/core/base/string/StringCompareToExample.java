		System.out.println(str.compareTo("DEF"));
		System.out.println(str.compareToIgnoreCase("abc"));
		
		//Above negative output is because ??ABC?? is lexicographically 
		//less than the ??DEF??. Output is -3 be
		//cause it compares the character values one by one. You can also confirm this 
		//with below test program.
		char a = 'A';
		char d = 'D';
		System.out.println(a-d);
		
//		So when ??ABC?? is compared to ??DEF??, the character at first index is compared.
//		Since they are different 
//		and ??A?? comes before ??D?? lexicographically, it returns a negative 
//		integer with the difference between them, hence output is -3.

//		So if you compare ??AABC?? with ??ADBC??, then also you will get 
//		the same output as -3. That??s all for java String compareTo 
//		JdbcQuickStartExample. Note that this method is not same as String equals method.
